I'm Manoj Krishnamoorthy S, an ECE graduate turning my passion for tech into a full-time pursuit. I’m learning the ropes of software development with core skills in Java, HTML, CSS, and SQL, and I’m actively exploring real-world projects that help me grow. I’m looking for a developer role where I can keep learning, build meaningful solutions, and contribute to a team that values curiosity and collaboration.
